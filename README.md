Sanger sequencing processing (study project)

_About ruby packages and stuff_

Tests
- for testing purposes, I use MiniTest (included in standard library): 
http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/minitest/unit/rdoc/MiniTest.html
http://blog.arvidandersson.se/2012/03/28/minimalicous-testing-in-ruby-1-9
-files with testcode are named <testedfilename>_spec.rb, where <testedfilename>.rb - is the name of file being tested

to execute test: call 'ruby <testedfilename>_spec.rb'
